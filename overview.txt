## 🔍 2. Problem & Motivation (1 min)

> "Many users—especially non-technical ones—struggle to explore CSV data. 
Traditional tools like Excel or Python scripts can be overwhelming. 
This chatbot bridges that gap by combining **AI + code execution + SQL + charting**, all behind a clean and simple chat interface."


## 🚀 3. Key Features (2 mins)

> "Here are some highlights of what the app can do:"

* 📊 **Natural language queries** for stats, visualizations, or insights
* ⚡ **Fast responses** for numeric queries (bypasses the AI)
* 🧠 **Groq API + LLaMA 3 model** for smart, context-aware answers
* 📈 **2D & 3D chart support**: pie, scatter, histogram, etc.
* 💾 **Downloadable** charts and chat logs
* 🎨 **Theme customization** and chat bubble-style UI
* 🧮 **Token tracking** and API usage counter
* 🔐 **Safe code execution**, input validation, and caching


## 🧱 4. Architecture Breakdown (3 mins)


### 🖥️ Frontend (Streamlit)

* File upload + chat interface
* Styled UI with chat bubbles, tabs, and metric cards
* Session state to preserve user history

### ⚙️ Backend

* **Query classifier** → routes query: stats / SQL / AI / code
* **Code executor** → safely runs Python code with result capture
* **SQL runner** → translates natural queries into SQL and runs them on in-memory SQLite
* **Charting engine** → plotly-powered visuals

### 🤖 AI Integration

* Groq API with **LLaMA3-70B**
* Context-aware prompt templates
* Smart fallback: direct Pandas execution when possible
* Result caching with MD5-based keys

### 📦 Caching System

* Saves repeated query results using Pickle
* Improves performance & reduces token cost


## 🤹 5. Query Flow Example (2 mins)

**Step-by-step flow:**

1. Input detected as **numeric filter**
2. Bypasses Groq → handled via Pandas
3. Filters data and returns result instantly

## 🧭 6. Conclusion & Future Scope (1 min)

> "To wrap up, CSV Chatbot makes CSV exploration intuitive and interactive by combining powerful AI with a simple UI.
It’s especially helpful for data analysts, students, and anyone who deals with raw datasets."

### 🛠️ Future Improvements:

* Chat threading and memory
* Advanced chart customization
* Multi-file support
* Integration with databases and Google Sheets
